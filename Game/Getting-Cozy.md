## Getting Cozy
Auxiliary Rooms provide static bonuses and special abilities to your ship and the POs that inhabit them. Unlike chassis, they are more open-ended.

### Finding And Buying Rooms
Auxiliary Rooms make great rewards and sometimes someone will want a very specific room which can be obtained using **I Know Someone**. Remember that there is a limit to the number of Rooms you can have installed, and therefore they should be compelling and exciting.

If creating your own Rooms, try to get creative and in some cases remember narrative rooms can be just as powerful as purely mechanical rooms.
