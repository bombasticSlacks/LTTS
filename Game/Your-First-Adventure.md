## Getting Started
* Make sure everyone has [made a Po](Making-A-Po)
* Make sure your crew has created a [spaceship](Making-A-Spaceship)

As you play you will learn more about the universe you exist in and what things exist within it. Don’t stress too much to start about the level of technology or advancement the average person carries with them and what kind of power structures exist within the galaxy. As you progress you will together figure out what these are and then make use of them yourself.

However, to begin you should go through the following:

### Who Are You?
Before you can get to know everyone else, you should be ready to answer the following questions about your character:

- Who was I before I joined this crew?
- What keeps me adventuring?
- What will I never tolerate?
- Why am I here?
- What do I look like right now?
- What kind of person am I?
- What should people call me, and how should they refer to me?

Once you have answers for at least a few of these questions, you should go around the table and tell each other a bit about your characters and your answers.

### How Did You Meet?
Now that you know more about each other its time to figure out a bit about how you know each other. Try to find a way each other character relates to you from the following list:

- I feel the need to protect ________.
- _______ is a trusted friend.
- I have much to learn from ________.
- I would follow _______ to the ends of the earth.
- _______ always makes things more interesting.
- _______ and I go way back.
- I still owe ______ from last time.
- Or a connection of your own, feel free to get creative!

Then speak with the other player about what that means to each of you so that you’re on the same page about your relationship.

### Everything Begins
Campaigns of Look To The Sky always begin in the middle of the action. You’ve already accepted a mission, a deal, contract whatever and are now on your way to complete it.

Talk with the GM about the following

- Where are we?
- Why are we here?
- What’s in it for us?
- What’s the holdup?

Once that’s all sorted out the rest will be easy. Start playing your characters get into the action, explore, build your legacy and fame.
