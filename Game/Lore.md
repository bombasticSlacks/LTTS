## Lore
In Look To The Sky, the players are all sentient lifeforms which have been digitally stored (and backed up) to keep their consciousness safe in the case of physical harm. In world, humans and other Aliens that have been transferred this way are referred to as Post Organics (POs). With advancements in technology leading to a lack of scarcity, POs live incredibly safe lives, sometimes lasting 100’s to 1000’s of years before deteriorating or getting bored and resetting themselves to experience life again. This life is supplemented by 3 major advancements making this experience possible Sleeving, AI Assistance, and Post Scarcity.

### Sleeving
The act of uploading your consciousness to an organic body. Since a POs consciousness is decentralized, they may at any point transfer their consciousness to any empty sleeve they have access and authority to use. There is a large business around designing and distributing “perfect” or otherwise artisanal sleeves. Anything from a gorgeous young assassin flexible with blades able to protrude from their elbows, a superhuman man able to lift a car and shoot energy from his eyes, a higher being able to think and conceive reality in impossible ways, to a sentient cat, or levitating octopus. Though most POs will have a sleeve they call “home”, all POs are comfortable sleeving and re-sleeving to some extent.

### AI Assistance
The act of learning and developing new skills has mostly been lost to time. With the advent of POs and the digitalization of consciousness, supplemental learning routines providing skills, talents and abilities can be added to a person's consciousness as easily as a person could plug in a computer peripheral. So though a person will have some basic level aptitude, they can within minutes become a master swordsman, an Olympic level runner, or understand the entirety of astrophysics.

### Post Scarcity
Fabrication has been mostly solved. Matter and usable items are created out of nowhere using Veema” a form of generalized matter. Every person carries around a personal 3-d printer referred to as a micro printer, a nanomachine swarm that can be deployed to quickly build any reasonably sized device. Large printers exist in many civilized areas and hubs and can be used to create everything from buildings to spaceships. This leads to a galaxy where anything can be created in minutes and the issue becomes finding detailed schematics and, in most cases, getting a license, so you can legally print the device.
