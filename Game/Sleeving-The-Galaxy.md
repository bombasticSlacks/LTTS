## A Buyer's Market
In almost all cases, unless a sleeve is marked as **Unique** or **Contraband,** obtaining a sleeve also gives you the licensing rights to print replacements. You can only have 1 sleeve per license existing at any time, but in the case of damage, destruction or loss you may print a new copy at any **Sleeve Printer,** destroying the old body in the process.

### Basics Of A Body
Unless otherwise specified or contradicted you can only be in 1 body at any time and every sleeve you are in requires: Food, Water and Sleep. Dies when it reaches 0 health, obeys the rules of physics and can deal 1 damage in melee with its fists.

Bodies consist of: **Health, Size, Style, Advantages, and Disadvantages**

#### Health
Every sleeve will have an individually tracked health value. This represents how hurt it is and is reduced when you take damage. If a sleeve is ever reduced to 0 health, it no longer works and your consciousness will be ejected and returned wherever your brain backup is stored (usually your ship's **Brain Bank**). If you try to jump into another body immediately after dying, you will have to perform the **Sleeve Shock** advanced move.

#### Advantages
A sleeve will usually have advantages, which are things that it provides beyond the basics expected of a body. These can be anything from **attribute increases** to **laser eyes**.

#### Disadvantages
A sleeve will sometimes (especially if powerful) have some number of disadvantages a PO will have to work around to use. Disadvantages can be mechanical in nature, but the best disadvantages are more open to interpretation and narrative. Some examples of disadvantages would be **-1 genius** or **terrified of the colour red.**

#### Size
Size represents how large a sleeve is. In general, sleeves are categorized in the following sizes:

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Tiny**|This sleeve is very small. As large as a fairy, bug, or small bird|
|**Small**|The size of a cat, average dog|
|**Medium**|The size of most humans and larger dogs / wolves|
|**Large**|The size of a bear, octopus, large shark|
|**Huge**|Gigantic animals such as whales|
|**Massive**|Larger than most buildings, no normal animal falls into this category|

#### Style
The style of a sleeve tells you a lot about the basics of the sleeve and what it looks like. Some examples of styles would be:

| **Style**    | **Description**                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Humanoid** | Two arms, Two legs, chest with important bits, a head with a face. Usual stuff. |
| **Animal**   | Reminiscent of an animal of some sort, usually moves on all fours and such.     |
| **Exotic**   | A stranger sleeve with less well-defined rules.                                 |

### Always Adapting
While playing if someone uses a sleeve in a different or interesting way feel free to add advantages and disadvantages to a current sleeve. **The starting character sleeves are intentionally sparse** **on advantages and disadvantages to let you discover more about them as you play.** These shouldn’t be new abilities but should solidify powers that have been already established. Like if a character thinks their military grade sleeve is a “a fast sprinter” and you agree that can be solidified as an advantage.

### Finding And Buying Sleeves
The galaxy is filled with millions of sleeves and variants. Sometimes POs will want a very specific sleeve which they can source using the **I Know a Guy** move, and otherwise sleeves make great rewards for adventuring. Remember also that you don’t need to find an intact body to get a sleeve as a reward, genetic code and some ingenuity can be just as good. In general, sleeves can’t be salvaged from fallen enemies using **Salvage What You Can,** however, in some cases or if you are very adamant about wanting to salvage, you may be able to find the tools/resources to do it. Creating sleeves is as easy as filling in the above information and remembering that the more powerful something is, the more (hopefully interesting) disadvantages it should have. Here are some example sleeves:
