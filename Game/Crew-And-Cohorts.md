## Along For The Ride
Crew and Cohorts are characters that are met throughout the story and become closely aligned with the party. They have interests and goals of their own, but usually want to work with the party to accomplish the team goals.

Crew and Cohorts are their own people. They will weave in and out of the story but quantifying them lets players know what they can do and what they will not do.

### Skills And Talents
These are things a Cohort is good at. When you ask or order a cohort to do something, these will dictate if it is possible for them to accomplish the task.

### Limits
These are things a cohort will never do under any circumstances. Forcing a cohort to do any of these should almost certainly guarantee they leave the party.

### Attributes
These are more quantifiable values. If they normally have armour, a signature weapon to deal damage with, their size, look, and hp value. All of that goes here.

### Loyalty
Loyalty is a measure of how aligned the character is with the party. If you do something awful to a companion or force them to break a limit, their loyalty will decrease. The levels are:

* Unwilling Allies.
* Cautious Compatriots.
* Allies.
* Underling.
* Worshipping.

### Patrons
Who does this person listen to? These are the people that can give them instructions.

### Goals
Cohorts will have goals and aspirations. Completing these for your Cohorts will help them develop.

If you successfully complete a Cohorts current goal work with your GM to give the cohort:

- A new Skill/Talent
- Remove a Limit
- Modify an Attribute
- Increase Their Loyalty
