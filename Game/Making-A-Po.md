## Being More Than Human
Characters in Look To The Sky always consist of a few distinct things: An Identity, Sleeve, AI Modules, and Equipment. All of these things will be provided as you make a character.

Any pieces of gear or sleeves your character receives in creation, you have a license for and can print replacements for in case of loss or damage. Don't be afraid to sacrifice to succeed.

### Identity
Your identity is who you are at your core. It consists of your Name, Base Core Attributes and your reputation.

- Give yourself a name, it can be anything you want.
- Your identity should have two Core Attributes it excels at. Those begin play at +1 your other two attributes begin at +0.
- Your Reputation begins at +0.
- Your Veema begins at 3, max Veema begins at 3.
- Your Juice begins at 3, max Juice begins at 3.
- Your Experience begins at 0, level at 0.

### SLEEVE
A sleeve is your body. Its your connection to the physical world and allows you to do some incredible things. Everyone begins play with the following:

#### Basic Humanoid Sleeve
Description: A simple humanoid sleeve. Has 2 arms, 2 legs, 1 head, and a body full of organs but otherwise can be printed to look like whatever you want.

Tags: Medium Size, Humanoid, 5 Health

Disadvantages: None

### AI Modules
AI Modules supplement your skills, attributes and abilities and can give you powerful new moves. Everyone can have at most 3 AI Modules active at any time (but more can be stored with their identity). Everyone begins play with the following module:

#### Skilled AI Module
A module in your brain giving you expertise over a specific domain or skill. Select something that this Module provides you knowledge of. Examples would include “swordsmanship”, “rocket science”, “persuasion”, “dancing”. Any time you make a move involving this skill add +1 to your roll.

### Equipment
Equipment is your first line of defence in any situation. Being prepared with the right tools can save your life. In general, a PO can carry up to 8 pieces of equipment on them. Everyone begins play with 3 Veema and a micro printer. Your microprinter and Veema are always connected to your identity and will instantaneously travel to you and your sleeve, no matter where you are in the galaxy. 1 Veema can be used to create any device or tool you have access to in seconds. Most advanced or powerful items require a license to print (meaning you will need to steal, buy or find the item first) but you can always print simple things like a flashlight, a medkit to heal 1-2 damage, a simple spacesuit, some rope, food.

### Being Special
Characters in Look To The Sky are more than just humans, though. They are adventurers, heroes, scientists, explorers, and they have certain things that put them above the rest. When you begin play, select a character background which will provide you with some more equipment, modules, and, in some cases, advanced sleeves. This book provides a number of [Classes](Classes), but you should feel encouraged to talk to your GM about any other custom archetype you would like to start as.
