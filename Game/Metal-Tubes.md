## Basics Of Chassis
Every chassis consists of at least a cockpit, but usually as size increases the number of luxuries and the comfort will as well. Every chassis at least has engines, navigation systems, an infinite power generator and an FTL drive of some sort. 

### Details
The main details of a chassis are **Size, Health, Armour, Auxiliary Rooms, Advantages, Disadvantages**

#### Health
Chassis have an amount of health before they are destroyed. When your chassis hp is reduced to 0 your spaceship no longer works. Prepare to drift through space until help arrives or to be boarded.

#### Armour
Chassis have an amount of armour which is reduced from all incoming damage.

#### Auxiliary Rooms
Each Chassis has a number of spaces for Auxiliary Rooms which it can fit and provide additional utility.

#### Advantages
Each Chassis has advantages, like stat increases, going really fast, a set of guns.

#### Disadvantages
Chassis can have disadvantages these can either be mechanical in nature like a negative to an attribute or narrative like A little cramped.

#### All Different Sizes
Chassis come in all different sizes.However, usually they can be classified as one of the following classes. Usually, an AI can only pilot ships of a certain size based on its experience.

|**Class**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Fighter**|A small 1-2 man ship. Consists of a cockpit and no other rooms.|
|**Transport**|A small ship. Usually without plenty of guns and armour, designed for transferring luxury goods and people small distances.|
|**Corvette**|The smallest a military vessel can be. Houses a small crew with a few amenities.|
|**Frigate**|A respectable ship for a small crew to manage. Has reasonable firepower and access to several additional systems and services.|
|**Destroyer**|A full-sized military ship capable of holding its own in any combat and armed with heavy weaponry. Requires a crew to keep things running smoothly.|
|**Freighter**|A full-sized transport ship. Only usually used in smuggling, luxury goods transporting and exotic novelty travel.|
|**Cruiser**|A giant spaceship requiring a large crew to maintain. Usually having large batteries of weapons that can be fired in unison to devastating effect.|
|**Capital**|The incredibly impressive flagships of factions. Nearly impossible to come into possession of, very few licenses are ever given out.|
|**Station**|A fully operational battle station. Approximately the size of a small moon. Requires a city worth of people to maintain and run.|


### Getting To Know The Ship
As you fly, especially if using the beginner chassis, it is encouraged you start to fill inthe advantagess and disadvantages of your ship. Maybe the scanners aren’t great, but it’s the fastest ship in the quadrant. Work with your GM to solidify these and make the ship truly your own.

### Getting New Chassis
The galaxy is filled with plenty of fancy new ship designs. It’s always worth remembering your AI has a maximum ship size it can pilot (this can be changed with experience). Finding a new abandoned chassis in space or finding a new more powerful chassis can be done with the I Know Someone move. Creating a new chassis is as easy as filling in the above information. Remember that a ship is given character with advantages and disadvantages. Here are some example chassis:
