## Look To The Skies
*A Game about exploration and adventure!*

![](Content/retro-spaceship.svg)

### Welcome To The Future
Look To The Sky is a powered by the apocalypse game with an advanced Space Opera setting where nothing is impossible. A galaxy where everyone is connected, nothing is scarce, and a powerful unique artifact or piece of technology is only a cave dive or a favour away.


### Nothing Is Too Far Fetched
In Look To The Sky almost all technological possibilities have been explored including things that modern humans would deem “impossible”. Faster than light and warp drives are abundant, Batteries last indefinitely, Fusion Reactors can power amazingly large structures, Mass Generators create moldable materials out of thin air.

### Be Anyone
Sentient life has spread so far and transhumanism and augmentation has extended to the point that the origins of species have been lost to time. Become anyone you want and tomorrow become someone else.
