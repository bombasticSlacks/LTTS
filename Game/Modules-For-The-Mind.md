## Basics Of AI Modules

AI modules provide static bonuses and special abilities to your characters. Unlike Sleeves and Equipment, they are more open-ended. They tend to appear as 6-8 inch long, 2-3 inch wide computer storage cards covered in electronics. Usually, they are uploaded directly to a PO’s identity destroying the chip in the process, however if an AI Module is found in the field every sleeve has an expansion slot that can take one AI Module temporarily until it is brought to a brain bank.

### Finding And Buying Modules
AI modules make great rewards and sometimes someone will want a very specific ability. In general AI modules are not found on defeated enemies as they are part of a user’s identity. However, some people will be using an AI module temporarily and these can be taken and don’t contain any DRM. Also get creative not every AI module needs to be manufactured! Maybe you can digitize the knowledge of a lost civilization and use that as a module, or the hunting part of a killed creatures brain looks like it might fit in your expansion slot.

If creating your own modules, other **powered by the apocalypse games** play book powers make great examples and ideas.
